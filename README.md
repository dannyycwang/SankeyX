## Abstract
In this study, we propose a novel visualization framework called SankeyX that connects user interaction sequences, model predictions, SHAP-based feature attributions, and business utility into a unified Sankey-style diagram. It enables users to trace how behavioral patterns contribute to model outcomes and assess their financial impact by a utility matrix. In case study, We also demonstrate its ability to reveal dominant purchasing patterns by using real world dataset. This method bridges the gap between explainable AI and decision-making for clickstream prediction.
